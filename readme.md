# 3 Week Insight Project

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks and data files developed during a 3 Week project as part of the Insight Data Science Fellowship program.

To copy it's recommended that you create a separate environment before installing the required packages to avoid potentially messing up your current Python setup. To create a new environment (here named "takeaseat") using Anaconda, run:
```
conda create -n takeaseat python=3.7
```

Switch to this environment by typing:
```
conda activate takeaseat
```

The minimum list of required packages is in the file `requirements.txt`. Automatically install them by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To make sure Jupyter Notebooks run correctly, install the iPython kernel manually:
```
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
